# Zeppein Discord Bot

Welcome to the **Zeppein** Discord Bot! ðŸŽ‰

Zeppein is a powerful and versatile Discord bot designed to enhance your server's moderation and community engagement. With a focus on user management, Zeppein offers a range of commands to help you manage your server efficiently.

## Features

- **Moderation Commands**:
  - Kick users from the server with the `!kick` command.
  - Ban users with the `!ban` command and provide a reason.
  - Unban users using the `!unban` command, just by mentioning their name and discriminator (e.g., `username#1234`).
  - List all banned users with the `!list_bans` command.

- **Logging**:
  - Every moderation action is logged in a dedicated channel (`mod-log`), ensuring transparency and accountability.
